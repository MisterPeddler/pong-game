# Pong Game

A basic pong game with a 'Murder Ball' mechanic.  The game was built with vanilla JavaScript everywhere except for a jQuery UI powered screen shake effect.  All graphics are dynamically rendered SVGs.

## MurderBall

Get a five point lead over your opponent and you release a small, slow, flashing ball that follows a random walk toward your opponent.

Don't let the murder ball touch your goal or you're in for a bad time...
